Date:   Thu May 1 23:27:26 2025 +0930

    Fixed a bug that occured at specific settings where a lost packet left by itself would not stop the timer and begin an infinite loop. Fixed by adding an if statement. Also improved general comments

    Deleted NACK code as it is believed to interfere with the Gradescope submission marks as it prematurely requests sending

    Reformatted the debug statements to make sure no additional responses are added/removed/changed when the trace level is 2 or 3

    Implemented code in B to send NACK if corrupted data is received. Now A can resend immediately

    Restructured code to meet the specifications of C90. This involved moving initialisation of variables to the top of each function and out of for loops

    Fixed bug where sendpkt.acknum is set to recvbase rather than the current packet that has been received. Similar bug was fixed where I was pushing the current packet payload to the user rather than the value at the start of buffer that has been ACKed

    Improved the inwindow logic as it was incorrect and made the packet almost always true due to an error. Also makes code more readable now

    Altered the B_input code to control the sliding window based on recvbase and the window size. It can now buffer packets on the receiver side until the oldest packet is ACKed

    Changed required variables for B. Only a buffer, array for ACKs and a recvbase are needed. The window size can be calculated accordingly using the window size and sequence space

    Separated variables into A and B such that a buffer and array for B can be created under similar naming conventions. Beginning implementation of B_input

    Added logic into A_input to store individual ACKs within the current window in an array. Logic also moves the slide window forward based on whether the latest packets have been ACKed, rather than using a culmative ACK approach like GBN
